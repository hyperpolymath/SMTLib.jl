== Current Position
SMTLib.jl is functionally usable and tested, but still needs release/governance hardening to match the operational posture used by Axiom.jl.

== Must (Current Stage)
- Keep package metadata and machine-readable state aligned for each release.
- Maintain changelog, roadmap, and release-readiness docs as release gates.
- Enforce CODEOWNERS + workflow security linting + pinned actions in CI.
- Keep `scripts/readiness-check.sh` passing in CI (strict mode).
- Keep install/load/test baseline healthy for JuliaHub-facing refs.

== Intend (Next Stage)
- Add solver-backed integration jobs by solver kind (z3/cvc5/yices/mathsat).
- Add deterministic evidence artifacts for capability and test summary claims.
- Add branch-protection alignment checklist to repo docs.
- Publish SMTLib.jl through the chosen registry path and document consumer migration.

== Like (Later)
- Add benchmark baselines and regression thresholds.
- Add solver compatibility matrix by version and operating system.
- Add richer failure diagnostics and strict-mode profiles for production environments.

== Scope Note
SMTLib.jl focuses on solver interoperability and verification plumbing.

The following are tracked as broader Axiom platform tracks, not SMTLib immediate blockers:
- Physics coprocessor production hardening
- VPU production hardening
- FPGA production hardening
- QPU baseline/production progression
